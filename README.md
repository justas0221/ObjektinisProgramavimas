# ObjektinisProgramavimas

This is the second subversion of my project v0.1

## Features

1. Has a defined structure of a student, which includes the name, surname, homework grades (the amount of grades per student is defined before the execution of the program), and grade of the exam.
2. Takes an input from the user to fill in the data for all the structure members for a certain amount of students (the amount of students is defined before the execution of the program).
3. After taking input from a user it accumulates the average homework grade for every student, and also calculates the final grade for every student.
4. At the end of the program it outputs the name, surname and final grade of every single student to the console.
5. Has a feature where the user can choose what method to use to count the final grade - by using average of the homework grades or by using the median of homework grades in the final grade calculation.
6. If any of the inputs done by the user are incorrect, he is informed about a mistake and is prompted to input a value again.
7. Has the feature where a user can enter the amount of students and grades per student at runtime.
8. Has two files, one is using dynamic memory to store student structures and their grades and the other uses vector for the same purpose and lets users input as many grades as they want at runtime.
9. Has all the code commented out.
