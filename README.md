# ObjektinisProgramavimas

This is the very first subversion of my project v.pradinÄ—

## Features

1. Has a defined structure of a student, which includes the name, surname, homework grades (the amount of grades per student is defined before the execution of the program), and grade of the exam.
2. Takes an input from the user to fill in the data for all the structure members for a certain amount of students (the amount of students is defined before the execution of the program).
